# Towards The Sunrise

![Cover](./Pictures/Cover.png)

Towards the Sunrise draws inspiration from arcade games like ["Race the Sun (2013)"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_the_Sun_(video_game)), emphasizing high scores, brief gaming sessions, and an infusion of pure enjoyment combined with exhilarating tension. The premise is straightforward: avoid collisions and keep soaring!
